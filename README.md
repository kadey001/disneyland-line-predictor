## Disneyland Line Predictor
While the existing theme park data sites are good at seeing the current wait times, I haven't found one that provides trends and predictions.

This webapp is designed to provide useful graphs for wait times and wait time trends. 

### Planned Features
- Store wait time data in our own database so we can build up historical data to be used in future model training and be viewed on the site.
- Train a model using this data and give predictions based on data such as historical data, day trends, and daily avg.
- Use model and live queue time data to predict the best time to get in line for any given ride.
- Include geolocation data to give more personalized suggestions on what the best ride to get in line for by factoring in ride distance.
- Expand to encompass more parks.
